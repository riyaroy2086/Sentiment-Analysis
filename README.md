# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis NLP Project

## Overview

 - This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project focused on Amazon product reviews. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment from customer reviews on Amazon.
 - Delves into sentiment analysis using two distinct techniques: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) employing a Bag of Words approach, and the Roberta Pretrained Model from ðŸ¤— Huggingface Pipeline.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction and Data Loading**
   - Imports necessary libraries and loads the dataset.

2. **Quick Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Displays a bar plot indicating the distribution of reviews by different star ratings.

3. **Basic NLTK**
   - Demonstrates NLTK functionalities such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

4. **VADER Sentiment Scoring**
   - Utilizes VADER to calculate sentiment scores for the text data.

5. **Roberta Pretrained Model**
   - Implements a transformer model (Roberta) for sentiment analysis.

6. **Comparing Scores between Models**
   - Compares sentiment scores obtained from VADER and the Roberta model.

7. **Review Examples**
   - Displays examples of positive 1-star and negative 5-star reviews, comparing text and model scores.

8. **Extra: The Transformers Pipeline**
   - Demonstrates using a pre-built sentiment analysis pipeline from the Transformers library.
